Columbia Theme V1.0.3, by Themes Collective
===========================================

Sweet! You're in the inner circle, good job!

If you're used to building HTML sites then you'll know your way around the theme files without any problems. If
you're new to developing, here's a few things to bare in mind:

1. DO NOT rename the index.html to anything other than 'index.html'.
2. This is the 'root' level of your site, so you should FTP everything in this folder to the root
of your server.
3. If you don't know what FTP is, (File Transfer Protocol), it's typically a method of transferring files onto the
web. Themes Collective recommends a free program, call FileZilla to get your site files uploaded to the web, found here > https://filezilla-project.org/
4. If you need help, please read through the documentation file bundled with your theme download package.
5. If you still need help, please leave us a message on the comments section on the marketplace where you purchased the
theme, or, alternatively you can send us an email to help@themescollective.com. Please note: we will require that you provide proof of purchase
before we offer support via email.
6. What's the .htaccess file all about? This file, (which may appear to be nameless when viewing this whole folder on your computer),
holds a necessary piece of code, that ensures we properly add support for our .htc file format. Why do we need support for .htc? Because
unfornately, IE8 doesn't support the css rule 'background-size: cover', which is needed throughout the theme. Therefore we have used a background polyfill
to enable this css attribute for IE8. OK, but what do I do with this .htaccess file? Just upload it to your server with the rest of this folder, ensuring
you don't move it from this location, (needs to be position at 'root' level). What if I already have an .htaccess file? Simply copy the code from this .htaccess
file to your existing file and you're good to go. Note: playing around with .htaccess files can whitescreen your whole site - make sire you make a full-backup
of your site before you start playing with your .htaccess file! 


Enjoy!
